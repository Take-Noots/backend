// Summary:
// Type files are used to define the structure of data objects in TypeScript.
// They ensure type safety, improve code readability, and provide a single source of truth for data structures used across the application.

// Detailed explanation:
// 1. Type Safety: Type files help catch errors during development by enforcing strict type checks.
//    For example, if a function expects a specific type, TypeScript will throw an error if the wrong type is passed.
// 2. Code Readability: By defining types in a separate file, developers can easily understand the structure of data objects without searching through the codebase.
// 3. Reusability: Types defined in a type file can be reused across multiple modules, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.
// 4. Scalability: As the application grows, type files make it easier to manage and update data structures without breaking the code.
// 5. Documentation: Type files act as a form of documentation, providing clear information about the expected shape of data objects.

// Example:
// export type DemoType = {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   description?: string;
// };
