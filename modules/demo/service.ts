// Simply the place where you contain core business logic and interact with the model layer.

// Detailed breakdown:
// This file is responsible for implementing the core business logic of the application.
// It ensures separation of concerns by keeping the business logic separate from the controller layer.
// The service layer interacts with the model layer to perform database operations and other computations.
// Each function in this file corresponds to a specific business operation and performs the following:
// 1. Validates and processes input data.
// 2. Interacts with the model layer to fetch, update, or delete data.
// 3. Returns the processed data or results to the controller layer.

// Example:
// const exampleFunction = async (data: any) => {
//     // Perform business logic here
//     const result = await demoModel.someOperation(data);
//     return result;
// };
