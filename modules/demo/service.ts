// Simply the place where you contain core business logic only.

// Detailed breakdown:
// This file is responsible for implementing the core business logic of the application.
// It ensures separation of concerns by keeping the business logic separate from other layers:
// - HTTP handling is delegated to the controller layer
// - Database operations are delegated to the repository layer
// Each function in this file corresponds to a specific business operation and performs the following:
// 1. Validates and processes input data.
// 2. Calls repository functions to perform database operations.
// 3. Returns the processed data or results to the controller layer.

// Example:
// const exampleFunction = async (data: any) => {
//     // Perform business logic here
//     const result = await demoRepository.someOperation(data);
//     return result;
// };
