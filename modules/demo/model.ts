// Simply the play to represent the data schema and interface with the database.

// Detailed breakdown:
// This file is responsible for defining the data schema and interacting with the database.
// It ensures separation of concerns by keeping database-related logic separate from the service and controller layers.
// The model file typically performs the following:
// 1. Defines the structure of the data using a schema (e.g., Mongoose schema for MongoDB).
// 2. Provides methods to interact with the database, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
// 3. Acts as the single source of truth for the data structure used in the application.

// Example:
// const DemoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
//     name: { type: String, required: true },
//     description: { type: String },
// });
// const DemoModel = mongoose.model('Demo', DemoSchema);
